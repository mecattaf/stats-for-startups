# Average Deal Size (Deal)

Your average deal size is the average size of your deals. It is the total revenue achieved in a set period (e.g., a month, a quarter, a year) divided by the number of closed-won opportunities for that segment. The segment can be new business, existing business, or total business -- whichever segment makes the most sense for your company to track). [^1]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Average Deal Size (Initial Contract)} = \frac{\textrm{Gross New ARR Bookings from New Customers in a time period}}{\textrm{\# of paying customers added in that period}} [^1],

\textrm{Average Deal Size} = \frac{\textrm{\$ value of all closed deals}}{\textrm{\# of deals}} [^2]
$$
