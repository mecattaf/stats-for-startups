# Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV)

Gross merchandize volume (GMV) is the total sales dollar value for goods sold or services purchased through the marketplace over a certain time. [^1] [^4] [^5] [^2]

While Gross Merchandise Value can be useful for a company in terms of understanding how many items are being sold and the amount of revenue being generated from them, it ultimately provides unrefined data that doesnâ€™t really express the true value of the goods being sold or business profitability. This is because the costs and expenses associated with the production, manufacturing, and advertising for the items are not factored in. [^3]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{GMV} = \textrm{sales price charged to customer}\times\textrm{\# of items sold} [^1] ,
\textrm{GMV} = \textrm{\# of transactions} \times\textrm{AOV} [^2]
$$
