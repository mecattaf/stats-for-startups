# Quick Ratio (Quick)

The quick ratio is “a quick heuristic to asses whether new business is growing way faster than the loss of existing business.  Also called the "acid test", a quick ratio is most relevant to business that has been around for at least a year, when a portion of the first year of customer's start churning.” We’ve personally found the quick ratio to help us quantify growth accounting into a single metric to understand and benchmark growth efficiency against other companies. The Quick Ratio gives a more accurate overview of a company’s financial health than the Current Ratio as it ignores liquid assets such as inventories. [^1] [^2]


A good quick ratio should be > 4 (For every $1 of downsell and churn, company is generating an additional >$4 of new and expansion) [^3]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Quick Ratio }= \frac{\textrm{New ARR + Expansion ARR}}{\textrm{Churn ARR + Downsell ARR}} [^1],

\textrm{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\textrm{new revenue + resurrected revenue + expansion revenue}}{\textrm{Churned + contracted revenue}} [^2],

\textrm{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\textrm{(new + resurrected)}}{\textrm{churned}} [^3],
 
\textrm{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\textrm{Cash + Accounts Receivable + Short-term investments}}{\textrm{Current Liabilities}} [^4]
