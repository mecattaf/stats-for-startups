# Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)

The EBITDA metric is a variation of operating income (EBIT) that excludes non-operating expenses and certain non-cash expenses. The purpose of these deductions is to remove the factors that business owners have discretion over, such as debt financing, capital structure, methods of depreciation, and taxes (to some extent). It can be used to showcase a firmâ€™s financial performance without accounting for its capital structure. [^1] [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{EBITDA = operating income + depreciation and amortization} [^1],

\textrm{EBITDA = (Revenue) - (Expenses Excluding Interest Tax Depreciation \& Amortization)} [^2],

\textrm{EBITDA = net profit + interest + taxes + depreciation and amortization} [^3]
