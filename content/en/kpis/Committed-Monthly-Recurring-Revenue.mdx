# Committed Monthly Recurring Revenue (cMRR)

Committed Monthly Recurring Revenue (CMRR) looks at current MRR, as defined as (New Business + Expansion – Contraction – Churn), and then adds in signed contracts going into production and subtracts out revenue that’s likely to churn within that period. [^1]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{cMRR} = \textrm{MRR} + \textrm{New business bookings} + \textrm{New upsell bookings} - \textrm{Downgrade bookings}- \textrm{Churn} [^1]
