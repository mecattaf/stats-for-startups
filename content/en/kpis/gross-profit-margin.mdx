# Gross Profit Margin (GPM)

Gross profit margin shows you how a product, or groups of products, is performing in your business and measures your business productivity. By monitoring your gross profit margin, you can address any potential weakness in your business before it becomes an issue. [^1]

Benchmarks depend on industry. As an example, manufacturers have an average gross profit margin of about 35 percent. Clothing industries typically have a 48-50% margin. Restaurants have margins from 35-40%. [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Gross Profit Margin} = \frac{\textrm{Gross profit}}{Revenue} [^1]
