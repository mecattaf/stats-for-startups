# Logins to Activation (LtA)

Out of all the unique visitors who visited your website, how many had an awesome first time experience? (this can be determined by tracking certain events. For example: and/or â€¦created an account + gave you their email address + clicked on a certain feature + stayed more than 5 minutes + added an avatar picture + added their first and last name + finished the walk-through).  [^1]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Activation Rate} = \frac {\textrm{Total \# of users who signed up to your website and had a great first time experience on your website}}{\textrm{Total \# unique visitors to your website}} [^1],

\textrm{Activation Rate} = \frac{\textrm{\# of website sessions}}{\textrm{\# activities completed}} [^2],

\textrm{Activation Rate \%}  = \frac{\textrm{Total Users who Complete the set milestone}}{\textrm{Total users who signed up}} \times 100 [^3]
$$
