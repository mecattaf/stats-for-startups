# CAC Payback Period (CPR)

The SaaS Metric CAC Payback Period is the number of months it takes to earn back the money invested in acquiring customers. It shows your break even point. This metric often goes by Time to Recover CAC or Months to Recover CAC.  [^1]

The general benchmark for startups to recover CAC is 12 months or less. High performing SaaS companies have an average CAC payback period of 5-7 months. Larger enterprises can (and often do) have a longer CAC Payback Period since they have greater access to capital. [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{CAC Payback Period} = 12 \times \frac{CAC}{ARPA }[^1],

\textrm{CAC Payback Period} = \frac{1}{\textrm{Magic Number}} [^2], 

\textrm{CAC Payback Period} = \frac{CAC}{\textrm{(MRR - Average cost of service)}}  [^3], 

\textrm{CAC Payback Period} = \frac{CAC}{\textrm{Average MRR per account }} [^4], 

\textrm{CAC Payback Period (months) } = \frac{CAC}{\textrm{ARPA} \times \textrm{Gross Margin}} [^5] , 

\textrm{CAC Payback Period}= \frac{\textrm{CAC Ratio}}{\textrm{Adjusted SaaS Gross Margin}} [^6]
