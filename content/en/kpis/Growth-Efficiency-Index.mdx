# Growth Efficiency Index (GEI)

The amount it costs to  get $1 annual contract value (ACV). [^1]
Best efficiency is 1:1. A GEI value of under 1 is viewed as optimal revenue acquisition, whereas values over 1 indicate suboptimal revenue acquisition. [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Growth Efficiency} = \frac{\textrm{Sum of sales and marketing costs}}{\textrm{Sum of annual contract value}} [^1]
$$
