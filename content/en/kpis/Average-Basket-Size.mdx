# Average Basket Size (ABS)

Average basket size refers to the number of items getting sold in a single purchase. This is an excellent support metric for AOV as it can provide context behind why AOV is either increasing or decreasing. [^1]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{ABS} = \frac{\textrm{Total Units Sold}}{\textrm{\# of Transactions}} [^1]
