# Capital Consumption Ratio (ConR)

We define capital consumption as cumulative capital consumed for each $1 of ARR achieved to date by year-end. [^1]
Capital consumed ratio is a measure of the total primary cumulative equity raised plus debt drawn minus cash on the balance sheet (adjusted for dividents/distributions) [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Capital Consumption Ratio} = \frac{\textrm{Total cumulative capital consumed}}{\textrm{ARR achieved}} [^1]
$$
