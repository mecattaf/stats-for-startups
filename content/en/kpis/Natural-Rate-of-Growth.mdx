# Natural Rate of Growth (NRG)

The intent of NRG is to peel back the layers of your business like paid marketing and sales to understand what the true impact of your product is for driving organic growth. NRG is the answer to the question “If no one from sales and marketing did their job for a quarter, how much would we grow?” [^1] [^2] [^3] [^4]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{NRG} = \textrm{Annual growth rate}\times \textrm{\% of product sign ups from organic channels} [^1]
$$
