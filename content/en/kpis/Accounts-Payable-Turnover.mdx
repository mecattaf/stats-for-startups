# Accounts Payable Turnover (APT)

The Accounts Payable Turnover KPI shows the rate at which your business pays off suppliers. The ratio is the result of dividing the total costs of sales during a period (the costs your company incurred while supplying its goods or services), by your average accounts payable for that period. [^1]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Accounts Payable Turnover} = \frac{\textrm{Total sales for a period}}{\textrm{Average accounts payable for that period}} [^1]
