# Return on Equity (ROE)

Return on equity (ROE) is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing net income by shareholders' equity. Because shareholders' equity is equal to a company’s assets minus its debt, ROE is considered the return on net assets. [^1] ROE is considered a measure of the profitability of a corporation in relation to stockholders’ equity. Measure profitability by examining your ability to generate revenue for each unit of shareholder equity. [^2] [^4] [^5] [^6] [^3]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{ROE} = \frac{\textrm{Net Income}}{\textrm{Average Shareholders' Equity}} [^1], 
\textrm{ROE}= \frac{\textrm{Net Income after taxes}}{\textrm{Average shareholder equity}} [^2]
$$
