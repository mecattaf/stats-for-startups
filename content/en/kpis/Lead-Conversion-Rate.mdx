# Lead Conversion Rate (LCR)

The Lead Conversion Rate is the percentage of visitors who come to your website and are captured as leads. This is one of the most important top-of-the-funnel conversion metrics. It’s an indicator of your ability to attract the right target audience and the efficiency at which your website is turns them into leads. [^1]
Across industries, the average landing page conversion rate was 2.35%, yet the top 25% are converting at 5.31% or higher. Ideally, you want to break into the top 10% — these are the landing pages with conversion rates of 11.45% or higher [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Lead Conversion Rate} = \frac{\textrm{Count(Leads)}}{\textrm{Count(Visitors)}} [^1]
$$
