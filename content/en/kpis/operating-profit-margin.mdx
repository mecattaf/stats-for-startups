# Operating Profit Margin (OPM)

The ratio of operating income to net sales, usually expressed in percent. This is used to measure the level and rate of profitability. [^1]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Operating Profit Margin} = \frac{\textrm{Operating Income}}{Revenue} \times 100 [^1],

\textrm{Operating Income} = \textrm{Gross Profit - Operating Expenses - Depreciation - Amortization} [^2],

\textrm{Operating Income} = \textrm{Net Earnings + Interest Expense + Taxes} [^3]
$$
