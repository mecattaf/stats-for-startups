# Sell Through Rate (STR)

Number of units sold in a period, divided by number of items at the beginning of the period. [^1]
What is a good sale through rate? It varies on a case by case basis, but the general rule of thumb is that anything above 80% is excellent while below 40% is concerning. So, between 40% and 80% should be okay. [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Sell-Through Rate} = \frac{\textrm{Number of units sold in a period}}{\textrm{Number of items at the beginning of the period}} [^1]
$$
