This is the percentage of people who almost complete a purchase, only to leave. They put something in their cart and maybe even make it all the way to checkout, but for some reason, they never finish their purchase.
The analysis of your Cart Abandonment Rate is similar to Churn rate. [^1]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Cart abandonment rate} = \frac{\textrm{Number of customers that add items to cart but don't purchase}}{\textrm{Number of customers who add items to cart}} [^1]
