# Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) measures the monthly amount of total revenue that’s subscription-based or recurring in nature and highly likely to continue into the future. This number excludes all one-time, non-recurring payments, such as implementation or professional service fees, hardware, and discounts. [^1] [^4] [^2] [^3]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{MRR}= \textrm{Average Monthly Subscription Value Per Customer} \times \textrm{Number of Customers}, 
\textrm{MRR} = \frac{ARR}{12} [^1]
$$
