# Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

Total sales volume of a particular product (or service) that can be sold by your company within a territory that you are able to service for the planned period (usually a year, a quarter or a month). “Can be sold” means realistic sales forecast made taking into account your production, logistic, sales and marketing capabilities, your competitors’ actions and influence, expected market trends and seasonality. [^1] [^4] [^5] [^6] [^7] [^2] [^3]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{SOM} = \textrm{\% of SAM you can realistically obtain} [^1], \\
\textrm{SOM = (Last Year's Market Share)} \times \textrm{(This year's SAM)} [^2]
$$
