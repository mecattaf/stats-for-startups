# Monthly Active User Growth (MAUg)

MAU Growth is a good proxy to show product traction, but only if the growth is sustained over a certain period of time. MAU Growth can be easily inflated if the product has recently been launched.

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{MAU(t) } - \textrm{MAU(t - 1 month)} = \textrm{new(t) + resurrected(t) - churned(t)} [^1]
$$
