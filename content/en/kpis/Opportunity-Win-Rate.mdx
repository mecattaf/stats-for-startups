# Opportunity Win Rate (OWR)

Win rate is the percentage of leads that convert to sales. This measures how many opportunities you won, divided by the total number of opportunities created. [^1] [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Opportunity Win Rate} = \frac{\textrm{Closed won deals in a time period}}{\textrm{Total \# of opportunities in that time period}} [^1]
$$
