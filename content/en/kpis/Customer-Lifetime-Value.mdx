# Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

A prognostication of the net profit contributed to the whole future relationship with a customer. Customer lifetime value can also be defined as the monetary value of a customer relationship, based on the present value of the projected future cash flows from the customer relationship. [^1] [^2] [^4] [^5] [^6] [^3]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{LTV} =\textrm{ customer value} \times \textrm{average lifespan} [^1],
\textrm{LTV} = \textrm{ARPA}\times \frac{1}{\textrm{Churn}},\\ 
\textrm{LTV} = \frac{\textrm{Average Monthly Revenue per Customer} \times \textrm{Gross Margin per Customer}}{\textrm{Monthly Churn Rate}}[^2], \\ 
\textrm{LTV} = \frac{\textrm{ARPA}}{\textrm{Revenue Churn Rate}} [^3] , \\
\textrm{LTV} = \textrm{ARPA} \times \frac{\textrm{Gross Margin \%}}{\textrm{Revenue Churn Rate}} [^4] , \\
\textrm{LTV} = \textrm{Margin} \times \frac{\textrm{Retention rate}}{1+\textrm{Discount Rate-Retention Rate}} [^5] , \\
\textrm{LTV} = \textrm{gross contribution per customer} \times \frac{\textrm{yearly retention rate}}{\textrm{1+yearly discount rate-yearly retention rate}} [^6] , \\
\textrm{LTV} = ((\textrm{Sale Price} – \textrm{Cost of Goods Sold}) \times (1 + \textrm{Referral Rate})) [^7]
