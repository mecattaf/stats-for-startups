# Net Sales Efficiency (NSE)

Net Sales Efficiency measures Net New ARR, which is reduced by Churn [^1]

A ratio between 0-0.5 usually indicates the company doesn't have a sustainable investable growth model and better sales efficiency is needed. A ratio of 0.5-1 is much better. A ratio of 1 or greater indicates strong sales efficiency and a capital-efficient growth model. [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Net Sales Efficiency} = \frac{\textrm{Net New ARR booked in current quarter}}{\textrm{Total sales \& Marketing expense in prior quarter}} [^1]
$$
