# Market Penetration Rate (MPR)

Market penetration is a measure of how much a product or service is being used by customers compared to the total estimated market for that product or service. Market penetration can be used to assess an industry as a whole to determine the potential for companies within the industry to gain market share or grow their revenue through sales. [^1]

For consumer products, market penetration should be 2-6%. For Business products, it should be 10-40%. [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Market Penetration} = \frac{\textrm{Sales Volume}}{\textrm{Total Sales volume of all similar products}} \times 100 [^1] ,

\textrm{Penetration Rate}= \frac{\textrm{Number of Customers}}{\textrm{Target Market Size}} \times 100 [^2]
$$
