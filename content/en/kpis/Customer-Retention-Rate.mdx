# Customer Retention Rate (CRR)

The percentage of customers retained over a given period of time. This is also referred to as “Logo Retention”. A 100% retention rate is always good. Meanwhile, a 15% retention rate is usually bad. Whatever is in between varies by the industry. [^1] [^2] [^3]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Logo Retention} = 1 – \frac{\textrm{customers churned in period}}{\textrm{customers at the start of the period}} [^1]
