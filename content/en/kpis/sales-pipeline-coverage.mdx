# Sales Pipeline Coverage (SPC)

Sales pipeline coverage (SPC) is how full your pipeline is relative to your quota for a given period. This valuable metric provides you with a good overview of your sales team’s performance and acts as an early warning sign if there are any potential threats to your business’ ability to grow.

## Calculation

\frac{\textrm{Pipeline Forecast}}{\textrm{Sales Forecast} }= \frac{\textrm{Average Sales Days}} {90 \textrm{Days}} \times \frac{1}{\textrm{ Close Rate}} [^1]
