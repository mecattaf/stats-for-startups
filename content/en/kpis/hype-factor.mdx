# Hype Factor (HYPE)

A way to quantify "hype" around a company. Hype has value to the extent it creates halo effects that drive interest in the company that ultimately increase ARR [^1]
A hype factor of 1-2 is the target. 2-3 is good, particularly before an IPO. A hype factor of 3-5 is not good, too much hype and too little ARR. A hype factor of 5+ is bad. 1.5  is a typical capital-to-ARR ratio on the eve of an IPO

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Hype Ratio} = \frac{\textrm{Capital Raised (or Burned)}}{\textrm{ARR}} [^1]
$$
