# Customer Churn Rate (CCR)

The percentage of customers who end their relationship with a company in a given period. This is also referred to as "logo churn". [^1] [^6] [^7] [^8] [^2] [^3] [^4] [^5]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Churn} = \frac{\textrm{Total Churned Customers over a period}}{\textrm{\# of customers on first day of the period}} [^1] , 

\textrm{Churn Rate} = \frac{\textrm{Total Churned Customers}} {\textrm{Midpoint of customer count for the month (rather than the value on the 1st of the month)}}[^2] , 

\textrm{Churn Rate} = \frac{\textrm{Total Churned Customers}}{\textrm{average of customer count between days 1 and n}} [^3]
$$
