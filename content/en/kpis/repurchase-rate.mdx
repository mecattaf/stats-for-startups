# Repurchase Rate (RepR)

A metric used to understand customer loyalty and the amount of revenue that can reasonably be expected from an ongoign customer relationship, specifically focusing at the rate at which customers make repeat purchases. This is most commonly used in businesses that have e-commerce and consumer product business models, not subscription-based models. [^1] [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Repeat Rate} = \frac{\textrm{\# customers who have shopped more than once}}{\textrm{\# of customers}} [^1],

\textrm{Repeat Purchase Rate (in a year)} = \frac{\textrm{\# of customers who have bought more than once in 1 year}}{\textrm{\# of total customers that year}} [^2]
$$
