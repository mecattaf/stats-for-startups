# Net Dollar Retention (NDR)

NDR measures the average percentage change in revenue over the first 12 months of a customer. It is the most cost-efficient way of accelerating revenue growth and value creation. Best-in-class SaaS businesses typically have net dollar retention rates above 110%, and many of the top performing SaaS IPOs of the past few years have had net dollar retention rates above 130%. Net retention below 100% means churn and downgrades were greater than any growth you enjoyed from the expansion of existing customers. [^1] [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{NDR} = \frac{\textrm{Starting MRR} + \textrm{expansion} – \textrm{downgrades} – \textrm{churn}} {\textrm{Starting MRR}}\times 100 [^1] , 
\textrm{TTM NDR} = \frac{\textrm{ARR from all customers today who were customers 12 months ago}}{\textrm{ARR from all customers 12 months ago}} [^2]
