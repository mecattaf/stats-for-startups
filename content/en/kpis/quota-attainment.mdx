# Quota Attainment (QA)

What percent of reps hit quota? This generally sits between 70-100% (if itâ€™s >100%, you need higher quotas). This is the anchor number for knowing whether to scale sales. Quota should be at least 3x OTE (on target earnings), hopefully more, for this to be meaningful. [^1]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Quota Attainment} = \frac{\textrm{Sales}}{\textrm{Target Sales}} \times 100 [^1]
$$
