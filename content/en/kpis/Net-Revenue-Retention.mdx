# Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

NRR measures the percentage of revenue retained from all customers (regardless of time as a customer) over a rolling moving 12-month window. In a SaaS business, a Net Revenue Retention Rate >100% is a growth indicator. Across all SaaS companies, the median Net Retention Rate is ~100%. Higher Annual Contract Value (ACV) products have a higher Net Retention Rates. For SaaS companies selling into small and medium businesses (SMBs), a good Net Retention Rate is 90%. For Enterprise SaaS, 125% is considered a good Net Retention Rate. [^1] [^2] [^3] [^4]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{NRR} = \frac{\textrm{Sum(renewing customers RR}} {\textrm{Sum(RR of customers due to renew}} [^1] , 

\textrm{NRR} = \frac{\textrm{\% value of renewed contracts} + \textrm{expansion MRR}}{\textrm{total value of contracts up for renewal}} [^2] , 

\textrm{NRR} = \frac{\textrm{MRR last month} + \textrm{Revenue Generated through Upgrades and cross-sells} - \textrm{Revenue losts through downgrades} - \textrm{Revenue lost through churn}}{\textrm{MRR Last Month}} [^3]
