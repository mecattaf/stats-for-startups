# Magic Number (Mgic)

The SaaS Magic Number is a widely used formula to measure sales efficiency. It measures the output of a year's worth of revenue growth for every dollar spent on sales and marketing. To think of it another way, for every dollar in S&M spend, how many dollars of ARR do you create. [^1]
The ideal range for the magic number is between 1 and 1.5, indicating efficient and sustainable sales and marketing efficiency. Most investors accept magic numbers from 0.5 to 1 because it shows that the company is on the right track. [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Magic Number} = \frac{\textrm{Net ARR}}{\textrm{Sales and marketing expenses}} [^1] ,

\textrm{Magic Number} = \frac{\textrm{GAAP Revenue this quarter} - \textrm{GAAP Revenue in the prior quarter} \times 4} {\textrm{Sales and marketing in prior quarter}} [^2] , 

\textrm{Magic Number Quarter Period} = \frac{\textrm{Current Quarter's Revenue} - \textrm{Previous Quarter's Revenue} \times 4} {\textrm{Previous Quarter's Sales and Marketing Expense}} [^3] , 

\textrm{Magic Number}= \frac{1}{\textrm{CAC Payback period}} [^4]
