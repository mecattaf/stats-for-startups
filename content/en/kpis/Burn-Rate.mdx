# Burn Rate (Burn)

Burn rate is a measure of how quickly a business is losing, or burning through, money. This is a particularly important metric for startups and venture-backed businesses that might be operating at a loss intentionally, investing more than theyâ€™re earning back into the business. Burn rate is typically calculated in monthly terms. [^1]
Regardless of its situation, any company should have a burn rate that ensures at least six months of cash runway. [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Burn Rate} = \frac{\textrm{Starting Balance} - \textrm{Ending Balance}}{\textrm{\# months}} [^1]
