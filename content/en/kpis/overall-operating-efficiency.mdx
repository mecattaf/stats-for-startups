# Overall Operating Efficiency (OOE)

OEE is calculated by multiplying Performance (whether equipment is operating at the rated speed and output) X Quality (measuring the rate of defective or discarded parts against overall output) X Availability (the percentage of available scheduled time that equipment is operating, excluding scheduled maintenance or scheduled downtime). [^1]

## Calculation

$$
OOE = Performance \times Quality \times Availability [^1]
