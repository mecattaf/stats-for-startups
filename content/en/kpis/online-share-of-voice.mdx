# Online Share of Voice (OSoV)

Online Share of Voice (OSOV) measures the relative share of online mentions of a brand (company or product) - especially in Social Media forums - relative to competitors. [^1]

Klout Score is an indicator of social media influence (for companies or individuals). Taking into account Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and other forums, it provides a score between 0 and 100 which is based on a number of (constantly evolving) criteria including the size of your network, the level of interactions. [^2]

Bounce Rate essentially represents a measure of website attractiveness. It measures the percentage of initial visitors to a website who 'bounce' away to a different site, rather than continue on to other pages within the same site. [^3]
As a broad rule of thumb, you're aiming for a website bounce rate of under 40%. Between 40% and 55% is usually okay, while 55-65% shows significant room for improvement [^4]

## Calculation

$$
OSoV = \frac{\textrm{Number of mentions for your brand}}{\textrm{Number of mentions for your brand and all your competitor brands}} \times {100} [^1],

\textrm{Bounce rate} = \frac{\textrm{\# of one-page visits}}{\textrm{total \# of entries to a website}} [^2]
$$
