# Conversion Rate (ConR)

Conversion Rate is a measure of the amount of visitors who have completed a goal on a website. The higher the conversion rate, the more successful the marketing campaigns. Examples of common conversions include: making a purchase, submitting a form, calling your business, engaging with your online chat, signing up for a subscription, registering on the site, downloading something, using something, upgrading their service, engaging in the site in some way. [^1]

A good conversion rate is above 10%, with some businesses achieving an average of 11.45%. Earning a good conversion rate places your company in the top 10% of global advertisers, which makes your conversion rate two to five times better than the average conversion rate. [^2]

Specifically, acquisition conversion rate answers the question: Out of all the unique visitors who visited your website from each channel, how many performed a basic action to start using your tool? (such as, and/orâ€¦created an account, clicked on a link, commented on a post, downloaded your app, stayed more than 2 minutes etc..) [^3]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Conversion rate} = \frac{\textrm{Conversions}}{\textrm{Total visitors}} \times 100 [^1],

\textrm{Acquisition Conversion Rate} = \frac{\textrm{Total \# of users who signed up to your website from a channel}}{\textrm{Total \# unique visitors to your website}} [^2]
$$
