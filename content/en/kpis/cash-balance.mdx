# Cash Balance (Cash)

This is simply the amount of money in your bank account. [^1] 

A positive net cash balance indicates that money is present and available in the account, while a negative one indicates that the account is overdrawn. [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Cash Balance} = \textrm{Deposits} - \textrm{Disbursements} [^1],
\textrm{Cash Balance} = \textrm{Money Received} - \textrm{Money Spent} [^2]
$$
