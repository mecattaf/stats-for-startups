# Operating Cashflow (OCF)

Operating Cash Flow (OCF) is the amount of cash generated by the regular operating activities of a business within a specific time period. OCF begins with net income (from the bottom of the income statement), adds back any non-cash items, and adjusts for changes in net working capital, to arrive at the total cash generated or consumed in the period. When performing financial analysis, operating cash flow should be used in conjunction with net income, free cash flow (FCF), and other metrics to properly assess a company’s performance and financial health.  [^1]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Operating Cash Flow} = \textrm{Net Income + Non-Cash Expenses – Increase in Working Capital} [^1],

\textrm{Operating Cash Flow} = \textrm{Net Income + Depreciation + Stock Based Compensation + Deferred Tax + Other Non Cash Items – Increase in Accounts Receivable – Increase in Inventory + Increase in Accounts Payable + Increase in Accrued Expenses + Increase in Deferred Revenue} [^2]
$$
