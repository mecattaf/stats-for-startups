# Historical Revenue Growth (HRGr)

Revenue Growth Rate measures the month-over-month percentage increase in revenue. Itâ€™s one of the most common and important startup metrics. The Revenue Growth Rate provides a solid indicator of how quickly your startup is growing. [^1]

Revenue Growth Rate is an indicator of how well a company is able to grow its sales revenue over a given time period. While the revenue is an actual number, the revenue growth rates simply compares the current sales figures (total revenue) with a previous period (typically quarter to quarter or year to year). [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Revenue Growth Rate} = \frac{\textrm{Revenue Period B - Revenue Period A}}{\textrm{Revenue Period A}} \times 100  [^1],

\textrm{Revenue Growth Rate} = \frac{\textrm{Revenue this period}}{\textrm{Revenue previous period}} [^2]
$$
