# LTV/CAC Ratio (L/C)

The Customer Lifetime Value to Customer Acquisition (LTV:CAC) ratio measures the relationship between the lifetime value of a customer, and the cost of acquiring that customer. The metric is computed by dividing LTV by CAC. It is a signal of customer profitability, and of sales and marketing efficiency.
The ideal LTV:CAC ratio should be 3:1 or greater. The value of a customer should be three times more than the cost of acquiring them. If the ratio is close, you are spending too much. [^1] [^2] [^3] [^4]

## Calculation

$$
LTV:CAC=\frac{LTV}{CAC} [^1]
