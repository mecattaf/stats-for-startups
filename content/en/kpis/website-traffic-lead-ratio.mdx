# Website Traffic Lead Ratio (WTLR)

Your website traffic to lead ratio simply means what percentage of visitors that come to your site turn into actual leads in any given time period. [^1]

If the ratio is no less than 2-4%, then your content strategy is working to attract the potential customers instead of simply driving people to your website thanks to the viral content without any other perspectives [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Website Traffic Lead Ratio} = \frac{\textrm{\# of website visits}}{\textrm{\# of leads generated over the same timeframe}} [^1]
