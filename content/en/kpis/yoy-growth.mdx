# YoY Growth (YoY)

Year-over-year (YOY) is the comparison of one period with the same period from the previous year(s). YOY growth compares how much youâ€™ve grown in the recent period compared to the past period(s). The period is typically a month or quarter (e.g., fourth quarter of 2020 compared to fourth quarter of 2019). [^1]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{YoY Growth} = \frac{\textrm{(this year - last year)}}{\textrm{last year}} \times 100 [^1]
