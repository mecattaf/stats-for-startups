# Fill Rate (FR)

Fill rate refers to the percentage of customer demand that is met by immediate stock availability, without backorders, stockouts or lost sales. [^1]

A good item fill rate rests right between 85-95%. Item fill rates and inventory management are incredibly important regarding customer service and sales. You never want to stockout or backorder products, as it negatively affects your company's customer service level and is a cause for lost sales [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Fill Rate} = \frac{\textrm{Number of products provided}}{\textrm{Number of products ordered}} [^1],

\textrm{Fill Rate} = \frac{\textrm{Total Number of Customer Orders Shipped }}{\textrm{Number of Customer Orders Filled}} \times 100 [^2]
$$
