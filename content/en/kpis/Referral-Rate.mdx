# Referral Rate (Rfrl)

The volume of referred purchases as a percentage of your total purchase. [^1]
The global average referral rate is about 2.3%. If you already have product-market fit, happy customers and a steady stream of customers from your existing acquisition channels, you can expect to increase your sales by about 2% minimum. [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Referral Rate} = \frac{\textrm{\# referred purchases}}{\textrm{\# of total purchases}} [^1]
$$
