# Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)

Capital efficiency is the ratio of how much a company is spending on growing revenue and how much they're getting in return. For example, if a company is earning one dollar for every dollar spent on growth, it has a 1:1 ratio of capital efficiency. You can also call it the return on capital employed, or ROCE [^1] [^2] [^3] [^4] [^5] [^6]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Capital Efficiency} = \frac{\textrm{ARR}} {\textrm{Total Cash consumed}} [^1] , 
\textrm{Capital Efficiency}= \frac{\textrm{How much company spends}}{\textrm{how much getting in return}} [^2]
$$
