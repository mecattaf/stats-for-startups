# Net New Weighted Pipeline (WP)

Pipeline generated in the previous period less pipeline removed (sold or lost) is a good indicator of market pull, and a leading indicator for scaling sales. Generally a bogus number early on, but good discipline to be in the habit of reporting. [^1]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Net New Weighted Pipeline} = \textrm{Previous period pipeline} - \textrm{Pipeline removed} [^1]
$$
