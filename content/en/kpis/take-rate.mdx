# Take Rate (Take)

Take rate, aka rake, is the percentage of GMV collected by the marketplace and typically falls between 10% and 30%. High take rates are associated with exclusivity. [^1]
e.g. The App Store can charge 30% because it's the single point of access to over one billion iOS devices [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Take Rate} = \frac{\textrm{Historical Revenue}}{\textrm{GMV}} [^1]
