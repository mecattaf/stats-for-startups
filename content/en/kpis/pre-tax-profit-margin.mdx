# Pre-tax Profit Margin (PtPM)

The pretax profit margin is a financial accounting tool used to measure the operating efficiency of a company. It is a ratio that tells us the percentage of sales that has turned into profits or, in other words, how many cents of profit the business has generated for each dollar of sale before deducting taxes. The pretax profit margin is widely used to compare the profitability of businesses within the same industry. [^1]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Pre-tax Profit Margin} = \textrm{Operating Income - Interest Expense} + \frac{\textrm{Interest Income}}{Revenue} \times 100 [^1],

\textrm{Pre-tax Profit Margin} = \frac{\textrm{Earnings before Taxes (EBT)}}{Sales} \times 100 [^2]
