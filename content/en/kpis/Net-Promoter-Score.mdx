# Net Promoter Score (NPS)

NPS is a metric used in customer experience programs. NPS measures the loyalty of customers to a company. NPS scores are measured with a single question survey and reported with a number from -100 to +100, a higher score is desirable. Promoters respond with a score of 9 or 10 and are typically loyal and enthusiastic customers. Passives respond with a score of 7 or 8. They are satisfied with your service but not happy enough to be considered promoters. Detractors respond with a score of 0 to 6. These are unhappy customers who are unlikely to buy from you again, and may even discourage others from buying from you. [^1] 
The NPS ranges -100 to 100. NPS  > 0 is good, and an NPS of 50 or more is excellent. [^2]
More than 2/3 of the Fortune 1000 use NPS to measure user or employee satisfaction. [^3] [^4] [^5]
