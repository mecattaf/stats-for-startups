# N-day Retention (Nday)

N-day retention measures how many of your users come back to your app on a particular day, the "nth" day. [^1]
For most industries, average eight-week retention is below 20 percent. For products in the media or finance industry, an eight-week retention rate over 25 percent is considered elite. For the SaaS and e-commerce industries, over 35 percent retention is considered elite. [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{N-day retention Rate} = \frac{\textrm{\# of users who open the app the Nth day after day 0}}{\textrm{\# of users who first used the app on day 0}} [^1]
