# Revenue Run Rate (RunR)

Run rate is the financial performance of a company, using current financial information as a predictor of future performance. The run rate functions as an extrapolation of current financial performance and assumes that current conditions will continue. This lets you forecast future earnings over a year based on past revenue data. [^1]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Run Rate (Annual)} = \textrm{Revenue in period Y} \times \textrm{\# of periods Y in one year} [^1]
