# Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

The cost of convincing a potential customer to buy a product or a service. [^1] [^3] [^4] [^5] [^2]
With software, customers usually prefer the self-service approach; so lower CAC ultimately means you can spend more on product; remove human touch fom the sales process as much as possible.

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{CAC} = \frac{\textrm{Sales} + \textrm{Marketing Expenses}} {\textrm{\# New Customers}} [^1] , 
\textrm{CAC} = \frac{\textrm{Total customer acquisition expenses}}{\textrm{\# of customers acquired}} [^2]
$$
