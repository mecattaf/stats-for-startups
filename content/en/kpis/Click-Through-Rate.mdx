# Click Through Rate (CTR)

A ratio showing how often people who see your ad or free product listing end up clicking it. Clickthrough rate (CTR) can be used to gauge how well your keywords and ads, and free listings, are performing. [^1] [^4] [^5] [^2]
The average CTR in Google Ads is 1.91% for search and 0.35% for display. But average is just that: average. So, as a rule of thumb, a good Google Ads click-through rate is 4-5%+ on the search network or 0.5-1%+ on the display network. [^3]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{CTR} = \frac{\textrm{\# of clicks that an ad receives}}{\textrm{\# of times ad is shown}} [^1]
