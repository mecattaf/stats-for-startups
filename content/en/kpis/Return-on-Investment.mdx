# Return on Investment (ROI)

Return on investment (ROI) is a financial metric that is widely used to measure the probability of gaining a return from an investment. It is a ratio that compares the gain or loss from an investment relative to its cost. [^1] [^2] [^3] [^4] [^5]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{ROI} = \frac{\textrm{Net return on investment}}{\textrm{cost of investment}} \times 100 [^1],  

\textrm{ROI} = \frac{\textrm{Final value of investment} - \textrm{Initial value of investment}}{\textrm{Cost of investment}}\times 100 [^2]
$$
