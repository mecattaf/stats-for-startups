# Renewal Rate (RR)

Renewal is a small part of retention. The renewal process is the actions you take to get customers to sign up for another term once their contract is up. [^1]
Typically, good services businesses have renewal rates of more than 80%, while more sticky software renewal rates hit 90% or more. [^2]
  
NOTE - Retention vs. Renewal: 
Retention--customers dont actively cancel when given the chance at any point in the subscription period.
Renewal--Customers actively choose to continue their subscription at the end of each subscription period

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Renewal Rate} = \frac{\textrm{\# of customers who renew subscription}}{\textrm{\# of customers up for renewal}} \times 100 [^1], 

\textrm{Renewal Rate} = 1 - \textrm{Churn} [^2]
$$
