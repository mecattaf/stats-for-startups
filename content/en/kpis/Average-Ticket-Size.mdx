# Average Ticket Size (ATS)

Average ticket size is the average amount a customer or party spends in one visit. This number can tell you how many monthly, daily–even hourly–visits you’ll need to attract on average in order to hit a given revenue goal. [^1]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Average ticket size} =\frac{\textrm{total receipt value for a period}}{\textrm{\# of customer visits in that period}} [^1], 
\textrm{ATS} = \textrm{(Price of Service Level 1)} \times \frac{\textrm{\# Customers Paying for Service Level 1}} {\textrm{Total \# Customers}} \\
+ \textrm{Price of Service Level 2} \times \frac{\textrm{\# Customers Paying for Service Level 2}}{\textrm{Total \# Customers}} 
\\+ \textrm{Price of Service Level 3 ...}
$$
