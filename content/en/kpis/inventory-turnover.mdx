# Inventory Turnover (IT)

The inventory turnover KPI allows you to know how much of your average inventory your company has sold in a period. The KPI gives you a picture of your company's sales strength and production efficiency. [^1] [^2]
A good inventory turnover ratio is between 5 and 10 for most industries, which indicates that you sell and restock your inventory every 1-2 months. This ratio strikes a good balance between having enough inventory on hand and not having to reorder too frequently. [^3]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{\textrm{Sales within a period}}{\textrm{Average inventory in the same period}} [^1],

\textrm{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{\textrm{COGS}}{\textrm{Average Inventory}} [^2]
$$
