# Lead Velocity Rate (LVR)

How many potential customers are considered very likely to become actual customers. The Lead Velocity Rate is the growth percentage of qualified leads month over month. It measures your pipeline development. That is, how many (quality) potential customers you're currently working on converting to actual customers. [^1] [^2] [^3]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{LVR} =\frac{\textrm{\# Qualified Leads Current Month} - \textrm{\# Qualified leads last month}}{\# \textrm{Qualified Leads last month}} \times 100 [^1]
$$
