# Net Burn (NB)

How much money the company spends in a month less what it makes from subscriptions (should be a positive number for companies that spend more than they make, negative if make more than spend). Net Burn is the amount a company is losing per month as they burn through their cash reserves. [^1]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Net Burn = Gross Burn - MRR} [^1],

\textrm{Net Burn Rate} = \frac{\textrm{Cash}}{\textrm{Monthly Operating Losses}} [^2],

\textrm{Net Burn Rate} = \frac{\textrm{Beginning Cash Balance - Ending Cash Balance}}{\textrm{Time Periods During Measurement}} [^3]
$$
