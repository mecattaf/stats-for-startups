# Gross Churn Rate (GCR)

A calculation of how much revenue is lost by customers not renewing or canceling during a given period of time.[^1]
A typical "good" churn rate for SaaS companies that target small businesses is 3-5% monthly. The larger the businesses you target, the lower your churn rate has to be as the market is smaller. For an enterprise-level product, churn should be <1% monthly.[^2]
A study from Recurly found that the average churn rate for businesses was 5% for B2B and 7.05% for B2C.[^3]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Revenue Churn} = \frac{\textrm{(MRR Beginning - MRR Ending) - MRR in upgrades}}{\textrm{MRR Beginning}}
