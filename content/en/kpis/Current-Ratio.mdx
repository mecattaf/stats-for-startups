# Current Ratio (Crnt)

Current Ratio KPI divides total assets by liabilities to give you an understanding the solvency of your businessâ€”i.e., how well your company is positioned to meet its financial obligations consistently on time and to maintain a level of credit rating that is required to order to grow and expand your business. [^1] 
A good current ratio is between 1.2 to 2, which means that the business has 2 times more current assets than liabilities to covers its debts. A current ratio below 1 means that the company doesn't have enough liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities. [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Current Ratio} = \frac{\textrm{total assets}}{\textrm{total liabilities}} [^1]
