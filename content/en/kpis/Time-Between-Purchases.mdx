# Time Between Purchases (TBP)

Time Between Purchases is exactly that metric that shows you how often a typical customer goes before making a repeat purchase. This is a good stat to know because it allows you to tailor email marketing campaigns to their behaviours. [^1]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{TBP (days)} = \frac{365 \textrm{days}}{\textrm{Purchase Frequency}} [^1]
$$
