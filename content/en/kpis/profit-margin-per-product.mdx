# Profit Margin Per Product (PMpP)

Profit Margin per Product will help you determine which products to push, how much you can discount, and where to keep a closer eye on things because margins are tight.

A good margin will vary by industry, but as a rule of thumb, a 10% net profit margin is considered average, a 20% margin is considered high, and <5% is low.

## Calculation

$$
PMpP = \frac{\textrm{Product price - Product cost}}{\textrm{Retail Price}}
