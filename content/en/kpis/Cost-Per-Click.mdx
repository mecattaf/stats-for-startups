# Cost Per Click (CPC)

This will tell you the exact cost of every click, made possible by marketing campaigns. [^1] For most businesses, a 5:1 revenue-to-ad ratio is considered acceptable. This means for every dollar spent in advertising, five dollars in revenue is produced. A 20% cost-per-acquisition, or CPA, is another way of expressing this ratio. [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{CPC} = \frac{\textrm{total spent on campaign}}{\textrm{\# of clicks}} [^1]
$$
