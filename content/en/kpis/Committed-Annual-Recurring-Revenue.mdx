# Committed Annual Recurring Revenue (cARR)

cARR stands for contracted (or committed) annual recurring revenue. It differs from ARR beause it takes into effect known future business and known future cancellations that donâ€™t yet show up in ARR. [^1] Total contracted annual recurring revenue is the single best metric for the health of a business. It encapsulates new logo growth, expansion, and churn in a single number. [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{cARR} = \textrm{ARR} + \textrm{Signed Contracts} - \textrm{Expected Churn} [^1] , 
\textrm{cARR} = \textrm{ARR} + \textrm{New business bookings} + \textrm{New upsell bookings} - \textrm{Downgrade bookings} - \textrm{Churn} [^2]
$$
