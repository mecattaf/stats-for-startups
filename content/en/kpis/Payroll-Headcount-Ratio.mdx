# Payroll Headcount Ratio (PHR)

This metric basically shows how many people are engaged in the payroll process in comparison to the total number of employees.  If the ratio is rising, it means that you’re adding labor costs so it might make sense to keep an eye on this metric so that you don’t experience potential financial difficulties. [^1]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Payroll Headcount Ratio} = \frac{\textrm{\# HR full-time positions}}{\textrm{\# full time employees}} [^1]
$$
