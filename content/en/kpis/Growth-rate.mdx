# Growth rate (Grow)

We measure growth as a rate, which is the ratio of the cumulative quantity at the end of a given period to that quantity at the beginning of the period. Looking at the growth rate on a monthly basis is typical. Older businesses may also want to look at yearly growth rates. Very early-stage businesses may want to focus on weekly growth rates. [^1] [^2] [^3]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Growth rate} = \textrm{New Rate} + \textrm{Resurrected Rate} + \textrm{Expansion rate} - \textrm{Contraction rate} - \textrm{Churn rate} [^1] , 
\textrm{Growth Rate} = \frac{\textrm{revenue(t)}}{\textrm{revenue(t-1)}} â€“ 1 [^2]
$$
