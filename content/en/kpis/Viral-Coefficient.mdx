# Viral Coefficient (Virl)

The number of new users an existing user generates. This metric calculates the exponential referral cycle - sometimes called virality - that accelerates company growth. [^1] [^2] The K-factor is a calculation that measures your initial customers and the number of invites they send out. The number of those invites that convert, when compared to the number of invites sent out, is an indicator of how popular each wave of invites will be. The higher the conversion rate, the more likely your product will go viral. [^3]
A K-Factor/Viral Coefficient of greater than 1 is the target. A viral coefficient of 2 means that every customer you acquire will bring in 2 more customers. A viral coefficient above 1 is advantageous to your customer acquisition costs because as users join through word of mouth and other unpaid channels, the CAC declines. [^4] [^5] [^6] [^7] [^8]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Viral coefficient} = \frac{\textrm{Number of customers} \times \textrm{Average number of referrals per customer} \times \textrm{average conversion rate for referrals}}{100} [^1] ,

 \textrm{Viral coefficient} = \textrm{average number of invitations sent existing user} \times \textrm{conversion rate of invitation} [^2], 

\textrm{Viral Coefficient} = \textrm{\# of invitations sent per user}\times\textrm{\% conversion rate} [^3]
$$
