# Risk Concentration (Risk)

Percentage of revenue generated by the top customer, or top 20% sellers/suppliers. [^1] [^2]
A rule of thumb holds that if any single customer accounts for ten percent or more of your revenue or if your largest five customers account for 25% or more of revenue, you have a high customer concentration.  [^3]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Customer Concentration Risk} = \frac{\textrm{Revenue from largest customer}}{\textrm{Total revenue}} [^1] ,

\textrm{Concentration} = \frac{\textnormal{Revenue Generated by top 20\% customers}}{\textrm{Total Revenue}} \times 100 [^2]
$$
