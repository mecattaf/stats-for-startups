# Average Revenue Per Account (ARPA)

Average revenue per account (ARPA) is a profitability measure that assesses a companyâ€™s revenue per customer account. ARPA is generally measured on a monthly or annual basis. Although the terms average revenue per account (ARPA) and average revenue per user (ARPU) are frequently used as synonyms, this is not always correct because one customer may have several accounts with a company. The ARPA metric is mostly used by companies operating on a subscription-based business model or those providing some type of services. [^1]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{ARPA} = \frac{\textrm{MRR}} {\textrm{\# Accounts}} [^1]
