# Customer Retention Cost (CRC)

The amount of money a company has to spend in a given period to retain an existing customer. Retention costs include customer support, billing, promotional incentives, etc. [^1]
Acquiring a new customer costs 3-6X the cost to retain one. The ideal is to lower the retention cost. [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{CRC} = \frac{\textrm{\# total retention costs}}{\textrm{\#of customers retained}} [^1] , 
\textrm{CRC} = \frac{\textrm{Total CRC of client bas}} {\textrm{\# of active customers in that period}}  [^2]
$$
