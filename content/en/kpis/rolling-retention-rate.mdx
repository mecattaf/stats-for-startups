# Rolling Retention Rate (RRR)

The rolling retention rate formula includes customers that return on a specified day or any day after. Basically, customers that perform a certain action on or after a certain day are considered retained, and more importantly, they are retained over the long-term. [^1]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Rolling Retention Rate} = \frac{\textrm{\# of customers on or after specified date}}{\textrm{\# of customers on Day 0}} \times 100 [^1]
$$
