# Gross Sales Efficiency (GSE)

Gross Sales Efficiency simply looks at Gross New ARR (which does not include churn) [^1]

A ratio between 0-0.5 usually indicates the company doesn't have a sustainable investable growth model and better sales efficiency is needed. A ratio of 0.5-1 is much better. A ratio of 1 or greater indicates strong sales efficiency and a capital-efficient growth model. [^2]

## Calculation

$$
\textrm{Gross Sales Efficiency} = \frac{\textrm{Gross new ARR booked in the current quarter}}{\textrm{Total sales + Marketing in the prior quarter}} [^1]
$$
